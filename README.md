# Bitcoin-Wallet-Skimmer
A proof of concept bitcoin wallet skimmer.

## What it does ##
Randomly selects a page from http://directory.io which stores all possible bitcoin public keys as well as their private keys. Then runs down all the wallets and check if they have any money in them.

## Why ##
This project is a simple proof of concept as there are such a large amount of pages its impossible to actually find a wallet with money in it
